9.1 The Convolutional Operation
==================================

Convolution is an operation on two function of a real valued argument.

The conv operation is usually denoted with an asterisk

In the case of indiscrete value

.. math::

	s(t) = (x * w)(t) = \int x(a)w(t - a)da

In the case of dsicrete value

.. math::
	
	s(t) = (x * w)(t) = \sum_{a=-\infty}^{\infty}


Note: w needs to be 0 for all negative arguments

* x: input
* w: kernel
* s: feature map
