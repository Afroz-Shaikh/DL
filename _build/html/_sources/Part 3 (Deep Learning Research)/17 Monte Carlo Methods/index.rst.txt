17 Monte Carlo Methods
===========================

Randomized algorithms, roughly 2 categories

* Las Vagas algorithms
	
	* always return precisely correct answer or report failed
	* consume random amount of resources: time or memory

* Monte Carlo algorithms
	
	* return answers with a random amount of error
	* error amount can typically be reduced by expending more resources
	* fixed computational budget, a Monte Carlo algorithm can provide an approximate answer
