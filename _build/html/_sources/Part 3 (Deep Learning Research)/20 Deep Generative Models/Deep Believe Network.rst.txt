Deep Believe Network
===============================

Deep believe networks:
 
* Generative models
* Several layers of latent variables, typically binary.
* Visible units: maybe binary or real
* No intralayer connection
* The connection between the top 2 layers are undirected
* Connections between all the other layers are directed, with arrows pointed toward the layer that is close to the data. 

A DBM with l hidden layers contains l weight metrices: :math:`W^{(1)}, W^{(2)} .... W^{(l)}`
