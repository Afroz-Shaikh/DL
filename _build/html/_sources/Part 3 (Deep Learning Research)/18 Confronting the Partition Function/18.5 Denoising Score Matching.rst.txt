18.5 Denoising Score Matching
=======================================

We may wish to regularize score matching, by fitting a distribution

.. math::
	p_{smoothed}(x) = \int p_{data}(y)q(x|y)dy

rather than the true :math:`p_{data}`. The distribution q(x|y) is a corruption process, usually one that form x by adding a small amount of noise to y.

Denoising score matching is epecially useful because in practice, we usually do not have access to the true :math:`p_{data}` but rather only  an emprirical distribution defined by samples from it. 

Several autoencoder training algorithms are equivalent to score matching or denoising score matching. These autoencoder training algorithms are therefore a way of overcoming the partition function problem.
