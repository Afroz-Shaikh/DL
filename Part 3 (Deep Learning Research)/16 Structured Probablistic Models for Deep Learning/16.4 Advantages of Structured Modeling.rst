16.4 Advantages of Structured Modeling
=============================================

* Allow us to dramatically reduce the cost of representing probability distributions as well as learning and inference. 
* Sampling accelerated in the case of directed model. 
* Allow us to explicitly seperate representation of knowledge from learning of knowledge or inference given existing knowledge. Makes our model easier to model or debug. 
	
	* We can design, analyze and evaluating learning algorithms and inference algorithmsthat are applicable to broad class of grapgs.
	* Independently, wen can design models that capture the relationships we believe are important in our data. 
	* Then combine different algorithms and structures.
