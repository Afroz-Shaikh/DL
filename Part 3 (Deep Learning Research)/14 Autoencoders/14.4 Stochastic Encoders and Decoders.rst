14.4 Stochastic Encoders and Decoders
======================================

Given a hidden code h, we may think of the decoder as providing a conditional distribution :math:`p_{decoder}(x|h)`. We may train the autoencoder by minimizing :math:`-lpg P_{decoder}(x|h)`.

* x is Gaussian, negative log-likehood yield mean squared error
* x is Bernoulli, yield softmax
